Additional interface routines, based on Aradi's interfaces (api.f90)
for quantum-espresso are gathered in the fortran file dftd3_qe.f90. 
dftd3_qe.f90 is release under GPL. Quantum ESPRESSO group acknowledge
BÃ¡lint Aradi for his help in debugging the calculation of stresses.

Original DFT-D3 version 0.9 file api.f90 has been slightly modified. Changes are
highlighted with the label (QE 2016).

There is a test program (test.x), which calculates the force and stress as obtained
directly from dftd3-API code, and compares the results with numerically computed 
force and stress from the obtained dispersion energy. 

Parameters for dftd3 calculation can be found in ../Modules/input_parameters.f90. The 
values there correspond to PBE functional. Parameter 'version' can take values
from 2 to 6, only version=3 (zero-damping) has been tested with pwscf.
